# Flashcard Generator App  [Click here](https://flashcard-generator.onrender.com/)

## Project Description

Flashcard Generator App is a frontend application for creating and managing flashcards. It allows users to create multiple flashcards within a group. The application consists of three main pages:

1. Create New Page:  
   This page enables users to create a new flashcard. It contains two forms: one for entering the name and description of the flashcard, 
   and another for adding individual card names and descriptions. The dynamic form is implemented using Formik. After clicking the Create 
   button, the flashcard will be created.

2. My FlashCard Page:  
   On this page, users can view all the created card groups. Each group is displayed with a heading, description, total number of cards 
   in the group, and a button for viewing the cards on the next page.

3. FlashCard Details Page:  
   This page allows users to view the created flashcards. Users can navigate between different flashcards by clicking on the sidebar 
   terms associated with each card group. Additionally, they can share, print, and download the flashcards.

## Features

● Implemented agile methodology for designing, analyzing, and developing the
frontend project. The entire project was planned out as a single sprint of 2
weeks.

● This application helps to create new flashcards and access created flashcards.

● Utilized React, React-Redux, and localStorage to manage data, React-router
for routing, and Tailwind CSS for component development and responsive
design.

● Improved the project’s efficiency by implementing validation using Formik.js
on all the existing input fields, and extensive testing was carried out, reducing
the project’s time complexity by 20%.
